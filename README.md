# Web-Scrapping of writer and reader profiles sof Medium blogposts using Selenium and bs4

This web scraper mainly does the work of collecting data to analyze writer and reader profiles of Medium blogposts.

I plan to implement some sort of topic analysis utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) together with Grid-search to find the top topics writers are publishing :smile:

Dependencies:
1. Selenium
2. Beautifulsoup4
3. pandas
4. requests

Install the packages using: ***pip install <package-name>***

You also need to have chromedriver installed in your system. You can find the latest Chromedriver for Win10 in this repo. Else, you can check [this](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) to get the chromdriver for your OS.
